# Daily-Quotes
In this project, I added an api of quotes in which you will get quote and its author name by clicking on the next quote button.
And If you want to post this quote on your twitter account then there is a tweet me text and on top of that there is a twitter image. So, When you click on that image
then you will redirect on your twitter account and yet you don't have to copy that quote when you click on that image and if you already loggin in twitter.
After clicking you will get redirect to your account with the copied quote and its author name.
